# Walkthrough
This write-up details a method for remotely triggering an electric water gun using an RC car controller. The approach is to bypass the electric gun trigger mechanism and solder it to the RC car transmitter, in this case it was the “forward” command from the controller. When the forward command input is given to the receiver, this will complete the circuit and make the electric water gun “activate”.



Equipment Needed:


•	1x: Electrically powered water gun (I used the gun attached below via AliExpress)

•	1x: Philips head screwdriver


•	1x: Soldering iron


•	1x: Scissors


•	1x: Heat gun (optional)


Step 0
•	Make sure that both the RC car and the electric water gun operate as intended before disassembly. This is to ensure that any components are not faulty during troubleshooting when required
•	Fully charge the lithium battery included with the electric water gun



Step 1
•	Unscrew the RC car shell via Philips screwdriver
